1. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^
   - values added: 20
2. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 
   - final result: 20
3. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^
   - values added: 20
4. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 
   - Returns an error since the variable "result" was defined with the "let" keyword, line 13 is not in the block where "result" was defined so it cannot access it.
5. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^
   - Returns an error since the variable result is defined by "const" meaning it cannot not be changed on line 7 hence causing an error.
6. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 
   - returns an error since "const" is a block scoped keyword so since result is declared in the if statement, it cannot be accessed outside of it on line 13, hence causing an error
